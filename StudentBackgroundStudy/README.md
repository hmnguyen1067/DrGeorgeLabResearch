# Motivations/Influences for selecting a major for university students in the US south east region

In this paper, we examine student participant backgrounds and their motivations for choosing academic majors and their intents after graduation. We use the learning method Random Forest to determine if there exists particular grouping of the data that provide meaningful insight as to what influences a studentâ€™s choice of major. We are mostly interested in discovering if there are any groupings that arise from the gender of the participants and if the field of study of the immediate family members has a significant influence.
